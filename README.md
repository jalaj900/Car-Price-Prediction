## Introduction

Predicting the price of used cars can be a challenging task due to various influencing factors. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the selling price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: Price at which the car is being sold (in lakhs)
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price of the car (in lakhs)
- `Kms_Driven`: Number of kilometers driven
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
- `Transmission`: Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
